## Endeavour Predict

Endeavour Predict is a new organisation brought into being at the start of 2023 to provide safe, reliable clinical calculators as web services.

Endeavour Predict is a wholly-owned, non profit subsidiary of the Endeavour Health Charitable Trust, and is incorporated in the UK as a Company Limited By Guarantee. It operaes as a non-profit organisation, with any operating surplus being used to create new and better services.

More information on Endeavour Predict, ClinRisk and Endeavour Health can be found [here].

## What do we do?

Endeavour Predict provides important clinical calculations to end users, by providing these as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are a way for computers to talk to each other in a standardised way, exchanging structured data that both computers can make sense of.

Building these clinical digital tools as APIs means we can have a 'single source of truth' which all EPRs can connect to, and receive clinically assured, warranted values for clinical calculations such as QRisk3, QFracture, QCancer, and QDiabetes.

In the future we plan to add other clinical tools in the future.
