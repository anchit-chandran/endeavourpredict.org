## The Strategy Is Delivery

Rather than spend our time developing a lengthy and discursive but never-enacted Strategy, we prefer to take the advice of the now-legendary [Government Digital Service Team](https://twitter.com/GDSTeam), whose motto was "The Strategy Is Delivery". They had recognised that too many organisations were making lofty and idealistic strategy documents but failing to deliver because of lack of internal delivery capability.

!!! quote "Mike Bracken of the GDS Team on 'The Strategy Is Delivery'"
    ["Mike Bracken, Executive Director of Digital at the Cabinet Office and Head of the Government Digital Service (GDS), will reflect on the lessons he has learned while leading the digital agenda across government, and set out the thinking driving GDSâ€™s strategy for the next Parliament."](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/online-event/digital-government-strategy-delivery-mike-bracken-head-government-digital-1)

    For more information on the work and philosophies of the GDS Team there is a book ["Digital Transformation At Scale"](https://public.digital/publications) which is a useful background read.

## How We Operate

Endeavour Predict work in an agile way, iterating rapidly on small increments to our projects. We use the standards of the modern Web and the tools and infrastructure which are used by other agile organisations. Extensive use of automation and testing means we can be confident in our service and products.

Our team comprises some of the foremost experts in the UK on clinical calculations and their real-world implementation. The Endeavour Predict team is composed of a tight formation of individuals who have extensive experience of practical and operational delivery of real-world health technology projects.

## Roadmap

Our initial focus is to deliver a **UKCA** certified **QRisk3** medical device for **England** which can be used by clinicians as soon as possible. Following that we will work on:

* Extending UKCA certification to include CE and UKNI marking, to allow use of QRisk3 in NI and elsewhere in Europe such as the Republic of Ireland (with some modifications to deprivation score lookup)

* Ensuring that clinical safety requirements of Welsh and Scottish Governments are met, noting that these are in some cases similar to the DCB0129 and DCB0160 requirements for England.

* Developing a further suite of similar digital clinical APIs, including QFracture, QCancer, QDiabetes, QBleed, QStroke, QThrombosis and many more.

* Improvements to user interface elements, provision of open source, free, 'reference standard' UIs for clinical digital tools.
