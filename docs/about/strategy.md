## The Strategy Is Delivery

In the spirit of the [Government Digital Service Team](https://twitter.com/GDSTeam)'s motto, *"The Strategy Is Delivery"*, we have focussed our efforts on developing a Strategy that can be realised, rather than lengthy, lofty and idealistic goals which are never delivered due to the lack of internal capabilities.

!!! quote "Mike Bracken of the GDS Team on 'The Strategy Is Delivery'"
    ["Mike Bracken, Executive Director of Digital at the Cabinet Office and Head of the Government Digital Service (GDS), will reflect on the lessons he has learned while leading the digital agenda across government, and set out the thinking driving GDSâ€™s strategy for the next Parliament."](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/online-event/digital-government-strategy-delivery-mike-bracken-head-government-digital-1)

## How We Operate

Endeavour Predict works in an agile environment, iterating rapidly on small increments to our projects. Like other agile organisations, we use the standards of the modern Web, with all its tools and infrastructure. Extensive use of automation and testing ensures confidence in our service and products.

The Endeavour Predict team is composed of a tight formation of individuals with extensive experience in the practical and operational delivery of real-world health technology projects. They are some of the foremost experts in the UK on clinical calculations and their real-world implementation.

## Roadmap

Our initial focus is to deliver a **UKCA**-certified **QRISK3** medical device for **England**, which can be used by clinicians as soon as possible.

On completion, we will work on:

* Extending UKCA certification to include CE and UKNI marking, to allow the use of QRISK3 in NI and elsewhere in Europe such as the Republic of Ireland (with some modifications to deprivation score lookup).

* Ensuring clinical safety requirements of Welsh and Scottish Governments are met, noting these are similar to the DCB0129 and DCB0160 requirements for England, in some cases.

* Developing a further suite of similar digital clinical APIs, including QFracture, QCancer, QDiabetes, QBleed, QStroke, QThrombosis and many more.

* Improvements to user interface elements, provision of free, open-source, 'reference standard' UIs for clinical digital tools.
