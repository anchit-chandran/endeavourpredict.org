## Endeavour Predict

Endeavour Predict, formed in early 2023, is a new organisation to provide safe, reliable clinical calculators as web services.

Endeavour Predict is a wholly-owned, non-profit subsidiary of the Endeavour Health Charitable Trust, incorporated in the UK as a Company Limited By Guarantee. It operates as a non-profit organisation, with any operating surplus being used to create new and better services.

More information on Endeavour Predict, ClinRisk and Endeavour Health can be found [here].

## What do we do?

Endeavour Predict provides important clinical calculations to end users, by providing these as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These allow computers to talk to each other in a standardised way and enable the exchanging of structured data.

Building these clinical digital tools as APIs creates a 'single source of truth', which all EPRs can connect to, and receive clinically-assured, warranted values for clinical calculations such as QRISK3, QFracture, QCancer, and QDiabetes.

In the future, we plan to add other clinical tools.
