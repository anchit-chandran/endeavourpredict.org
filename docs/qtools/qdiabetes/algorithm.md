We release our algorithms as open-source software under the [GNU Affero General Public Licence, version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This ensures that academics and others interested in the core of the algorithms at least start with a working implementation. The terms of the licence ensure that implementations are transparent and open, and are, in turn, open for others to use and/or modify under the same licence.

You can view the open-source code which implements the heart of the algorithm [here](https://qdiabetes.org/src.php).

We recommend that for clinical use, software developers use our professionally supported software development kits.
