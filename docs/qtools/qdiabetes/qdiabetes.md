The QDiabetes® algorithm has been developed by doctors and academics working in the UK National Health Service and is based on routinely collected data from many thousands of GPs across the country who have freely contributed data for medical research.

QDiabetes® is intended for use in the UK. Recent NICE guidance recommends that GPs and other primary healthcare professionals use a validated computer-based risk-assessment tool, such as QDiabetes, to identify people on their practice register who may be at high risk of type 2 diabetes. The tool should use routinely available data from patients' electronic health records.

All medical decisions need to be taken by a patient in consultation with their doctor. The authors and the sponsors accept no responsibility for clinical use or misuse of this score.

The science underpinning the QDiabetes® equations has been [published](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/338/mar17_2/b880) in the British Medical Journal, where it is known as QDScore®. We've changed the name because we think that it is better.

QDiabetes®-2018 includes some new or amended risk factors. See the paper describing the updated algorithm in the British Medical Journal here: [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j5019](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j5019).
