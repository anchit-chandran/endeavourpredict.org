The QStroke® algorithms have been developed by Julia Hippisley-Cox, Carol Coupland and Peter Brindle, and are based on routinely collected data from many thousands of GPs across the country who have freely contributed data to the QResearch database for medical research.

QStroke® has been developed for the UK population, and is intended for use in the UK. All medical decisions need to be taken by a patient in consultation with their doctor. The authors and the sponsors accept no responsibility for clinical use or misuse of this score.

The science underpinning the QStroke® equations was published online in the BMJ on the 2nd May 2013.
