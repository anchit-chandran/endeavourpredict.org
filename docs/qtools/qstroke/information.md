## What is QStroke®?

QStroke® is a validated tool which predicts the absolute risk of developing a stroke or transient ischaemic attack in the next 10 years.

## Why has it been developed?

Stroke is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality.

Methods to identify patients at high risk of stroke are needed to identify patients for whom interventions may be required, especially those with atrial fibrillation for whom anticoagulation might be needed

Current risk scoring methods such as CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASC are not based on a statistical model, and do not include many established risk factors or provide absolute risk estimates of stroke.

## What factors are needed to calculate a QStroke® score?

QStroke® uses the same factors as the QRISK®2 cardiovascular risk score: age; sex; ethnicity; deprivation score (linked to postcode); smoking status; diabetes; atrial fibrillation; rheumatoid arthritis; chronic renal disease; treated hypertension; family history of coronary heart disease in a 1st degree relative under 60 years; cholesterol/HDL ratio; systolic blood pressure; body mass index.

In addition, it includes three extra factors which are: valvular heart disease; congestive cardiac failure; heart attack/angina;

## Which patients can you use it in?

QStroke® can be used in any patient aged 25-84 without an existing diagnosis of stroke or TIA and not currently taking anticoagulants.

In particular, it can be used to assess risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation to help assess the need for anticoagulation

## What are the special features of QStroke® compared with other risk tools?

QStroke® is a new algorithm to quantify absolute risk of primary stroke or transient ischaemic attack which includes established risk factors

QStroke® is based entirely on variables which the patient is likely to know or information which is recorded in the GP practice computer.

It has been designed to integrate well with QRISK®2 - many of the questions overlap and so it is possible to combine QStroke® and QRISK®2 into a combined vascular risk assessment.

It has been developed by academics and doctors working in the NHS using data from the QResearch database (www.qresearch.org) which includes more than 650 general practices across the UK. The very large and representative population means that the results will generalise well to primary care patients in the UK.

It has been formally validated on a separate population of patients registered with practices which were not used to develop the model. The results show it accurately predicts the level of risk (which is called calibration) and also distinguishes well between people who do and don't have strokes (i.e. discrimination).

QStroke® will be updated regularly to take account of changing incidence of stroke, increasing prevalence of risk factors (such as increasing prevalence of diabetes) and improvements to data quality.

## How does QStroke® compare with CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASC?

QStroke® provides a valid measure of absolute stroke risk in the general population of patients initially free of stroke or TIA as shown by its performance in a separate validation cohort.

CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASC do not provide absolute risk estimates of stroke.

The results of the validation study show that QStroke® shows some improvement on current risk scoring methods, CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASC, for the subset of patients with atrial fibrillation for whom anticoagulation may be required.

QStroke® is available for all GP system suppliers to integrate as with QRISK®2. It can be integrated as:

- A calculator tool which can be used to risk assess patients within the consultation using data already recorded in the clinical system. This is very efficient and will store the result in the clinical record so that it can be used for analyses and reporting in the practice
- A batch processing tool which allows you to calculate a risk score for every patient and generate a list of high-risk patients for further assessment and intervention
