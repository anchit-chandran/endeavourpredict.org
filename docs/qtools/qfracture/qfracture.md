The QFracture Algorithm has been created to calculate the risk of developing any osteoporotic (i.e. hip, wrist, shoulder or spine) fracture or hip fracture alone by answering some simple questions.

The QFracture®-2016 algorithm has been developed by doctors and academics working in the UK National Health Service and is based on routinely collected data from many thousands of GPs across the country who have freely contributed data for medical research.

QFracture®-2016 has been developed for the UK population, and is intended for use in the UK. All medical decisions need to be taken by a patient in consultation with their doctor. The authors and the sponsors accept no responsibility for clinical use or misuse of this score.

The science underpinning the QFracture® equations was published in the BMJ online on the 22nd May 2012. You can find this, and details of the 2016 update, on the publications page.

  - **4.2.4 Summary** Fracture-risk assessment should be carried out, preferably using Qfracture, prior to DXA in patients with clinical risk factors for osteoporosis and in whom antiosteoporosis treatment is being considered.
