The scientific paper which describes the development and validation of QFracture®-2012 has been published in the British Medical Journal, _BMJ 2012;344:e3427_. You can download a copy of the paper here:

The research underpinning QFracture-2009 has been published in the British Medical Journal, _BMJ 2009;339:b4229_, which you can see here:

- [Hippisley-Cox, J., Copeland, C., Predicting risk of osteoporotic fracture in men and women in England and Wales: prospective derivation and validation of QFractureScores, _BMJ 2009; 339:b4229_](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/nov19_1/b4229).

Additional validation of QFracture-2009 has been published by an external team using an independent dataset and the performance was found to be very good. The authors concluded that QFracture-2009 is a useful tool for predicting the 10 year risk of osteoporotic and hip fractures in patients in the United Kingdom. (Our own validation of QFracture-2012 shows that it improves on QFracture-2009.) The 2009 paper can be found here:

Here is a comparison of QFracture with the FRAX algorithm, prepared for the NICE review of fracture risk scores conducted in 2011 by the QFracture authors:

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis:

Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 2015 doi: 10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207907](http://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2015/08/06/annrheumdis-2015-207907.abstract)

Here's another validation study:

- [Hippisley-Cox J, Coupland C, Brindle P. The performance of seven QPrediction risk scores in an independent external sample of patients from general practice: a validation study. BMJ Open 2014;4:e005809](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e005809.abstract)

Here's information on the 2016 update:

and here is an independent external validation of QFracture-2016, both in patients with COPD and the general population, done in 2019:
