The QAdmissions algorithm calculates a patient's risk of an emergency hospital admission.

The QAdmissions® algorithms have been developed by Julia Hippisley-Cox and Carol Coupland and are based on routinely collected data from many thousands of GPs across the country who have freely contributed data to the QResearch database for medical research.

QAdmissions® has been developed for the UK population and is intended for use in the UK. All medical decisions need to be taken by a patient in consultation with their doctor. The authors and the sponsors accept no responsibility for clinical use or misuse of this score.

The scientific paper which describes the development and validation of QAdmissions® was published in BMJ Open in 2013. Please see the publications section of this site for more details.
