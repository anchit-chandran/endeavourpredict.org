# Python requirements for the Endeavour Predict documentation site

# this installs Material for MkDocs and all dependencies

# **** MATERIAL FOR MKDOCS INSIDERS ****
# IMPORTANT: This project uses Material for MkDocs **Insiders** Edition.
# To install this you will need a GitHub token which is available (for Endeavour Predict team only)
# from Marcus Baw (pacharanero).
# If you have the token, you can manually run this command to install Insiders:
# pip install git+https://<INSERT_GH_TOKEN_HERE>@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
# Further information is at https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/getting-started/
# In production/deployment, the relevant GitHub workflow has access to the token.

# **** MATERIAL FOR MKDOCS ****
# In a situation where you need to run the documentation site locally but can't
# get access to the GitHub token, you can uncomment the line below to access the normal version.
# Most things will work fine, but some features will be disabled:

# mkdocs-material

# for the feature which displays authors at the bottom of the page
mkdocs-git-committers-plugin-2

# for the feature which displays last edit date at the bottom of the page
mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin

# for the feature which enables 'foldable' admonition text (used for large code blocks)
mkdocs-macros-plugin

# for the PDF export feature
