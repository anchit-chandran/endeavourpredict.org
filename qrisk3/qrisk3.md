QRISK3 is the successor to the extremely well established QRISK2 clinical calculation, with the same purpose: estimating an individual patient's cardiovascular (CVD) risk over the ensuing ten years. QRISK2 has been extensively used in clinical practice both in the UK and internationally, for more than a decade.

QRISK3 is a complex calculation requiring reference to a number of additional risk-related patient-specific parameters compared to QRISK2 - including ethnicity, deprivation index, and a measure of systolic blood pressure variability.

QRISK3 is now the NICE-preferred mechanism for estimation of CVD risk to inform and guide subsequent conversations with patients regarding their options to manage this risk.
