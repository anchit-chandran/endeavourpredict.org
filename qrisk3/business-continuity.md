## Disaster Recovery

Endeavour Predict's technical team has developed a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) to facilitate a rapid return to normal service in the event of a significant outage.

This plan, for security reasons, is one of the few part of our documentation which is not open access. However if users or customers wish to see or discuss our DRP then they are welcome to request this via the contact page.
